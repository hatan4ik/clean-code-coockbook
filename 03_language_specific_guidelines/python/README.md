# Python Language Specific Guidelines

This section provides a deep dive into writing clean, robust, and performant Python code, with a focus on modern paradigms.

### Topics

- **[Asyncio](./asyncio.md)**: Best practices for writing asynchronous code with `asyncio`.
- **[Dependency Injection](./dependency_injection.md)**: How to use dependency injection to write loosely coupled, testable code.
- **[Metaprogramming](./metaprogramming.md)**: Techniques for writing code that writes code, and how to use it to reduce boilerplate.
- **[MyPy](./mypy.md)**: How to use `mypy` to add static typing to your Python code, catching bugs before they happen. This section covers strict mode, type-hinting complex structures, and integrating `mypy` into your CI/CD pipeline.
- **[Pydantic](./pydantic.md)**: How to use `pydantic` for data validation and settings management.
