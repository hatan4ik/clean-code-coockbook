*   **Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD):**
    *   **Principles:** We advocate for short-lived feature branches, automated testing on every commit, and automated deployments to staging and production.
    *   **Tools:** We will provide examples using `GitHub Actions`, but the principles can be applied to any CI/CD system.
